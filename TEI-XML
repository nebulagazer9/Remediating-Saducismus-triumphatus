	A relation of the Strange Witchcraft Discovered in the Village Mohra in Swedeland, 
	Taken out of the publick Register of the Lords Com-
	missioners appointed by his Majesty the King of 
	Sweden to examine the whole business, in the 
	Tears of our Lord 1669, and 1670..

	The News of this Witchcraft coming to the King's 
	Ear, his Majesty was pleased to appoint commissio-
	ners, some of the Clergy, and some of the Laity, 
	to make a Journey to the Town aforelaid, and to 
	examine the whole busines; and accordingly the 
	Examination was ordered to be on the 13th of August; and the 
	Commissioners met on the 12th instant, in the said Village, at 
	the Parson's House, to whom both the Minister and several peo-
	ple of fashion complained with tears, of the mise-
	rable condition they were in, and therefore begg'd of them to
	think of some way, whereby they might be delivered from
	that Calamity. They gave the Commissioners very strange In-
	stances of the Devil's Tyranny among them; how by the help 
								of

	of Witches, he had drawn some Hundreds of Children to him, 
	and made them subject to his power; how he hath been seen
	to go in a visible shape through the Country, and appeared dai-
	ly to the people; how he had wrought upon the poorer sort, 
	by presenting them with Meat and Drink, and this way allu-
	red them to himself, with other circumstances to be mentioned 
	hereafter. The Inhabitants of the Village added, with very 
	great lamentations, that though their Children had told all, and
	themselves, fought God very earnestly by Prayer, yet they were 
	carried away by him; and therefore begg'd of the Lords Com-
	missioners to root out this hellish Crew, that they might regain
	the former rest and quiteness; and the rather, because the Children 
	which used to be carried away in the Country or District of 
	Elfdale, since some Withces had been burnt there, remained un-
	molested. 
		That day, i.e. the 13th of August, being the last Humilitati-
	on.day Instituted by Authority for removing of this Judgment, 
	the commissioners went to Church, where there appeared a 
	considerable assembly both young and old: the Children 
	could read most of them, and sing Psalms, and so could the
	Women, though not with any great zeal or fervour. There were
	preached two Sermons that day, in which the miserable cafe of 
	those people, that suffered themselves to be deluded bu the De-
	vil, was laid open; and these Semrons were at last concluded
	with very fevent prayer.
		The Publick Worship being over, all the people of the Town 
	were called togheter to the Parson's House near Three thousand
	of them. Silence being commanded, the King's Commission
	was read publickly in the hearing of them all, and they were
	charged under very great Penalties to conceal nothing of what 
	they knewand to say nothing but the truth; those especiallt, 
	who were guilty, that the Children might be delivered from the
	Clutches of the Devil. They all promised obedience; the guil-
	ty feignedly, byt the guiltless weeping and crying bitterly.
		On the 14th of August the Commisioners met again, consult-
	ing how they might withstand this dangerous flood; after long
	deliberation, an Oder also coming from his Majesty, they did
	resolve the execute such as the matter of fact could be proved
	upon; Examination being made, there were discovered no less
	than Threescore and ten in the Village aforesaid, Three and
	twenty of which freely confessed their Crimes, were condem-
	ned to dye; the rest, one pretending she was with Child, and
	the other denying and pleading not guilty, were sent to Faluna,
	where most of them were afterwards Executed.

	PAGE 3 OF RELATIONS. 
	Fifteen Children which likewise confessed that they were en-
	gaged in this Witchery died as the rest; Six and thirty of them 
	between nine and sixteen years of age, who had been less guil-
	ty, were forced to run the gantlet; Twenty more, who had no 
	great inclination, yet had been reduced to those gellish Enter-
	prizes, because they were very young, were condemned to be 
	lash'd with Rods upon their hands, for three Sundays togheter 
	at the Church-door; and the aforelaid Sic and thirty were also
	doom'd to be lashed this way, once a weeb, for a whole year, to-
	gheter. The number of the Seduced Children was about three
	hundred. 
		On the twenty fifth of August, Execution was done upon the 
	notoriously guilt, the day being bright and glorious, and the 
	Sun shining, and some thousands of people being present at the
	Spectacle. The order and Method observed in the Examina-
	tion was thus. 

	??????????????PUNKT ELLER SEMIKOLON????????????????

		First, the commisioners and the Neighbouring Justices went
	to prayer; this done, the Witches, who had most of them Chil-
	dren with them, which they either had Seduced, or attempted,
	to Saduce, from four years of age to sixteen, were set before 
	them. Some of the Children complained lamentably of the
	misery and mischief they were forced sometime to suffer of the
	Witches.
		The children being asked wheter they were sure, that they
	were at any time carried away by the Devil; they all declared 
	they were, begging of the Commissioners that they might be
	freed from that intolerable flavery.
		Hereupon the Witches themselves were asked, wheter the
	Confessions of these Children were true, and were admonished to
	confess the truth, that they might turn away from the Devil unto
	the living God. At first, most of them did very stiftly, and with-
	out shedding the least tear deny it, though much against thei
	will and inclination
		After this, the Children were Examined, every one by them-
	selves, to see wheter their confessions did agree or no; and the
	commissioners found that all of them, except some very little
	ones, who could not tell all the circumstances, did punctually
	agree in the confessions of particulars. 
		In the mean while the Commissioners that were of the Clergy 
	examined the Witches, could not bring them to any confession, 
	all continuing the steadfast in the denials, till at last some of them
	burst out into tears, and their confession agrreed with what the
	Children had said. And these expressed their abhorrency of the 
	fact, and begg'd pardon; adding, that the Devil, whom they
