        <head>The Translator's PREFACE TO THE READER SHEWING 
	What Credit may be given to the Matter of
	Fact related in the ensuing Narrative.</head>
	<p>That we are to believe nothing, but what we have
	seen, is a Rule so false, that we dare not call our selves
	rational Creatures, and avouch it; yet as irrational as the 
	Maxim is, 'this become modish with some Men, and shoe
	no very mean Wits neither, to make use of it; and though
	they will hardly own it in its full latitude, yet when it comes
	to Particulars, let the Reason to the contrary be never so preg-
	nant or convincing, they'll hubb it as their sacred Anchor, 
	and laugh at all those credulous VVretches, that without see-
	ing, are so easily chous'd into an imprudent Confidence. And 
	this pittiful Stratagem we find practifed in no affai so much
	as that of spirits and Witches, and Apparitions, which must
	all be Fancies, and Hypocondriack Dreams, and the effects
	of distempered Brains, because their own are so dull as not to
	be able to pierce into those Mysteries. I do not deny but the
	Imaginations may be, and is sometime deluded; and melan-
	choly People may Fancy they bear Voices, and see very strange</p>

	<header>The PREFACE</header>
	<p>things, which have no other foundation but their own weak-
	ness, and like Bubbles break into Air, and nothing, by their
	own vanity.</p> 
		<p>Yet as no Man doth therefore take unpolisht Diamonds, to be
	Pebbles, because they do look like them, so neither must all
	passages of this Nature, we hear or read of, be traduced as
	self conceited, or deided as Old Wive's Fables, because some 
	smell strong of Impostrure and Sophistication. VVe believe some 
	Men of Reason and Experience, and free from Fumes, when
	a person of ordinary Intellectuals finds no great credit with
	us; and if we thing our selves wise for so doing, why should
	any Man so much forget himself, as to be an Infidel in
	point of such Phenomena's, when even the most judicious
	Men have had experience of such Passages? It seems to me
	no less than madness to contradict what both wise and un-
	wise Men do unanimously agree in; and how Jews, Heath-
	thens, Mahometans and Christians, both learned and un-
	learned, should come to conspire into this Cheat, as yet seems
	to me unaccountable. If some melancholy Monks or old
	Woman had seens shuch Ghosts and Apparitions, we might then
	suspect, that what they pretended to have seen might be no-
	thing, but the effect of disorded Imaginations; but when
	the whole VVorld, as it were, and Men of all Relitions, Men
	of all Ages too, have been forced by strong Evidences, to ac-
	knowledge the truth of such occurences, I know not what
	strength there can be in the Argument, drawn from the con-
	sent of Nations in things of a sublimer Nature, if here it
	be of no efficacy. Men that have attempted to evade the places
	of Scripture, which speaks of Ghosts and VVitches, we see, how
	they are forced turn and wind the Texis, and make in a 
	manner Noses of VVax of them, and rather squeeze than
	gather the sence, as if the holy VVriters had spoke like So-
	phisters, and not like Men, who made it their business to 
	condescend to the capacity of the common People. Let a Man
	put no force at all on those Passages of Holy VVrit, and then
	try what Sense that are like to yield. It's strange to see, 
	how some Men have endeavoured to clude the Story of the 
	VVitches of Endor; and as far as I can judge, play more</p>
	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">Hocus</fw>
	<pb n="3"/>
	<header>The PREFACE</header>
	<p>Hocus pocus tricks in the explication of that passage, than the 
	VVitches of herself, did in raising the deceased Samuel. To
	those Straits is Falshood driven, while Truth loves Plain, 
	and undisguised Expressions; and Errour will seek out Holes
	and Labyrinths to hide it self, while Truth plays above board,
	and Scorns the subterfuges of the Sceptick Interpreter. Men
	and Brethren, why should it seem a thing incredible with
	you, that God should permit Spririts to appear, and the De-
	vil to exert his Power among Men on Earth? Hath God
	ever engaged hiw VVord to the contrary? Or is it against
	the nature of Sprits to form themselves new Vehicles and vi-
	sible shapes, to animate grossler substances to shew themselves
	to Mortals upon certain occasions?</p>
		<p>I am so much a Prophet, as to foresee what will be the
	fate of the ensuing story, nor can i suppose that upon the 
	reading of it, Mens Verdicts will be much changed from
	what they were, if they have set up this Resolution, to be-
	lieve nothing that looks like the shadow of an Apparition, 
	though the things mentioned here, cannot be unknown to any
	that have been conversant with Forreign Affairs of late Years.
	And though there cannot be a greater evidence; than the
	testimony of a whole Kingdom, yet your nicer Men will think
	it as disparagement to them to believe it; nor will it ever
	extort Assent from any, that build the reputation of their
	Wit upon contraditing what hath been received by the
	vulgar.</p>
		<p>The passages here related wrought so great a consser-
	nation, not only on the Natives, but Strangers too, that 
	the Heer Christian Rumpf, then Resident for the States 
	General at Stockholm, thought himself obliged to fend a-
	way his little Son for Holland, left he should be endan-
	gered by those villanous Practices, which seemd to threa-
	ten all the Inhabitants of the Kingdom. And be that doubts
	of it, may be satisfied at Dr. Harrel's in St. James's Park, 
	to whom the Letter was written. And a Friend of mine
	in Town, being then in Holstein, remember very well
	that the Duke of Holstein sent an Express to the King of
	Sweden to know the truth of this famous Witchcraft:</p>
	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">To</fw>
	<pb n="4"/>
	<header>The PREFACE</header>
	<p>To whom the King modestly reply'd, That his judges and
	Commissioners had caused divers Men, Women, and Chil-
	dren to be Burnt and Excecuted opon such pregnant Evidences, 
	as were brought before them; but whether the Actions they
	confessed, and which were proved against them, were real, or
	only effects of strong Imagination, he was not as yet able to
	determine.</p> 
		<p>Add to all this, that the Circumstances mentioned in the
	ensuing Narrative, as I am informed, are at this Day to be
	seen in the Royal Chancery at Stockholm, and a Person of
	my Acquintance offered me to procure Copy of them under the
	Hand of publick Registers, if I desired it: Not to mention
	that in the Year 72. Baron Sparr, who was sent Embassador
	from the Crown of Sweden to the Court of England, did up-
	on his Word aver the matter of Fact recorded here, to be un-
	doubtedly true, to several Persons of Note and Eminency, with
	other particulars, stramher than those let down in these Papers.
	And to this purpose divers Letter were sent from Sweden and
	Hamburgh to several Persons here in London; insomuch, 
	that should a Man Born in, or acquainted with those Parts, 
	bear any Person dispute the Truth of it, he would wonder
	where People have lived, or what sullen Humor doth Posses 
	them, to disbelieve that, which so many Thousands in that
	Kingdom have felt the sad effects of.</p> 
		<p>Since the first Edition, it hath been my Fortune to be ac-
	quainted with the Lord Leyonberh, Envoy extraordinary
	from the King of Sweden, living in York Buildings, with
	whom discoursing about these Affairs, I found that the Account
	he gave, agreed for the most part with what is mentioned in 
	the Narrative; and because his Testimony, being a publick
	Person, may be of some moment in a thing related to that
	Kingdom, I habe here set it down in his own Words.</p>

	<p>Having read this Narrative, I could no lo lefs, than
	upn the Request of the Translator and Publisher
	of this Story, acknowledge, That to my best re-
	membrance, and according to the best Reports
	that have been made to me, the matter of Fact
	mentioned in it, is true, and that the Witches con-
	fessed such things, and were accordingly Excecuted.</p>

	<p>I do not take upon me to justise the Truth of what the Wit-
	ches said, for dealing with the Father of Lies, it's probable, 
	Veracity is not Vertue, that they greatly study, yet that the
	Devil speaks Truth sometimes, is a thing so far rfom being im-
	possible, that if we give credit to the sacred History, we must 
	grant that all be saith is not false or erroneous. All i design
	at this time, is only to suggest, that it is not altogheter irra-
	tional to conceive, that be or his Emmissaries are capable of such
	Actions and Pranks, as are related in these Papers.</p> 
		<p>That a Spirit can lift up Men and Women, and grosser Sub-
	stances, and convey them through the Air, I question no more
	than I doubt that the Wind can overthrow Houses, or drive
	Stones, and other heavy Bodies, upward from their Centre, 
	And were I to make a Person of a dull Understanding, appre-
	hend the Nature of a Spirit, I would represent it to him under
	the Notion of an intelligent WInd, or a strong Wind, in-
	formed by a highly rational Soul; as a Man may be called an 
	intelligent piece of Earth. And this Notion David seemed to
	favour, when speaking of these Creatures, Pfal. 104. 4. he 
	tells us, that God makes his Angels Wind, for in the Origi-
	nal it's <unreadable character> and most certainly, of they be so, they must be 
	reasonable windy Substances; nor doth the Expression, which
	immediately follows in that Verse, cross this Exosition, viz.</p> 
	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">That</fw>
	<pb n="6"/>
	<header>The PREFACE</header>
	<p>That he makes his Ministers a flaming FireK for it’s no new
	Opinion, that some of thise invisible Substances are of a Fiery, 
	and others of an Airy Nature; and as we see, God gives 
	rational Creatures here on Earth, Bodies composed of grosser
	matter, why should it seem incongruous for him to give rati-
	on Creatures above us, Bodies of a subtiler and thinner Mat-
	ter, or such Mattyer, as those higher Regions do afford? And 
	if Wind breaking forth from the Caverns of Hills, and Moun-
	tains have such force, as makes us very often stand amazed
	at the effects, what Energy might we suppose to be in
	Wind, were it inform’d by Reason, or a resonable Being?</p>
	<p>And though I cannot comprehend the Philosophy of the De-
	vils committing Veneral Acts, and having Children, and
	those Children upon their Copulation bringing forth Toads and
	Serpents, yet I can very rationally conceive, that having more
	than ordinary power over Matter, he can either animate dead 
	Bodies, and by the help of them commit those Villanies, which 
	Modesty bids us to conceal; or some other way compound, and
	thicken Atomes into what shape he pleases, especially if he meet
	with no hindrance from a higher power. And het at was
	permitted, as we see int the Gospel, to possess and actuate liv-
	ing Men, and wo with them almost what be pleased, why may 
	not be commit wickedness by such Instruments, and cast Mists
	before the Witches Eyes, that they may not know who they 
	are? And het hat could in Egypt produce Frogs, either real or
	conterfeit ones, why may not he be supposed to be able to pro-
	duce such Toads and Serpents out of any mishapen Creatures, and
	lumps of Matter of his own compounding, at least represent; the
	shapes of them to be really such things as they seem to be. Nor is this to 
	be admired in the Devil more than Tricks are in Juglers, 
	who by flight of Art can represent things to the ignorant
	Spectator, which hes hall be ready to swear to be real, though
	they are nothing less, and I suppose we may allow the Devil a 
	greater degree of cunning, than an odrinary Jugler.</p> 
	<p>However, Spirits that know the Nature of material things
	better than the deepest Philophers, and understand better
	how things are joyned and compounded, and what the Ingre-</p>
	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">dients</fw>
	<pb n="7"/>
	<header>The PREFACE</header>
	<p>dients of Terrestrial productions are, and see things (grosser 
	things at least) in their first principles, and have power over
	the Air, and other Elements, and have a thousand ways of
	shaping things, and representing them to the external Senses
	of vicious Men, what may not they be supposed to be able to 
	do, (if they have but Gods permission to exert their power)
	and that God doth sometimes permit such things, we have
	reason to believe, who read what signs and wonder Simon
	Magus, and Apollonius Tyanæus wrought by the power
	of darkness, and how not a few Men sin to that degree, that
	God suffers them to be led Captive by the Devil, and dooms
	them to that  slavery we read of in Revelation, Het hat is
	filthy, let him be filthy still.</p> 
	<p>Spirits by being Devils do not lose their Nature; and let
	any Man in sober sadness consider, what Spirits are said to be 
	able to do in Scripture, and what they have done, and com-
	pare those Passages with what is said in the following Relation, 
	and he will not think those things the Witches confessed, altogheter
	impossible.</p> 
	<p>Yet still, as I said before, I do not pretend to be their Ad-
	vocate,  but shall leave it to the Reader to judge of the truth, 
	or untruth of their Confessions, as he sees occasion, only  beg of him 
	not to condemn every thing as a Falshood, before due con-
	sideration of what Spirits are capable of doing.</p> 
	<p>That in so great a multitude as were Accused, Condemn’d, 
	and Excecuted for Witches, there might be some who suffured
	unjustly, and owed their death more to the Malice of their 
	Neighbours, than to their skill in the black Art, I will readily
	Grant; now will I deny, that when the News of these Trans-
	actions, and how the Children Bewitched fell into Fits, and 
	strange unusual Postures, spread abroad in the Kingdom, some
	fearful and credulous People, if they saw their Children any
	way disordered, might think they were Bewitched, or ready 
	to be carried away by Imps: This happens in all Consterna-
	tions, and our Fears make us see that which unbyassed Eyes
	cannot perceive; and of this a Gentleman who was an Ear.
	Witness, gave me this instance, of a Minister’s Child of his 
	Acquaintance, not far from Stockholm who being told,</p> 
	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">And</fw>
	<pb n="8"/>
	<header>The PREFACE</header>
	<p>and assured by his Wife, that the Child was carried to Bloc-
	kula every Night, and convey'd back into his Bed again, re-
	solved to fit with the Boy, and see whether any Devil durst
	be so bold as to snatch him out of his Arms. The Child
	went to Bed, and between 12 and 1 of the Clock at Night, 
	began to groan in his sleep, and seemed to shiver a little, at 
	the sight whereof the Mother began to weep and Mourn, think-
	ing that the Child was just going to be snatch away, but 
	her Husband smiling at the Conceit, and pleading with her, 
	that the Child's laying his Arms out of Bed, might be the
	cause of these Symptoms, took the Child in his Arms, and there
	kept him till towards 2 or 3 of the Clock, but no Spirits came
	or medled with him, yet was his VVife so possest with the
	conceit, or fear of Transportation, that his strongest Arguments
	could scarce make her believe the contrary; and the same Per-
	son (a near Relation of the aforesaid Envoy) added, how 
	much malice and ill nature was able to effect, whereof he gave
	this Example, which himself saw, and could testifie the Truth
	of, viz. How in the Year, 1676, at Stockholm, a young
	Woman Accused her own Mother of being a Witch, and Swore
	possitively, That she had carried her away at Night; where-
	upon both the Judges and Ministers of the Town, exhorted her
	to Confession and Repentance; but she stifly denied the Allega-
	tions, pleaded Innocence, and though they burnt another Witch
	before her Face, and lighted the Fire she her self was to burn in 
	before her, yet she still justified her self, and continued to do so
	till the last, and contuing so, was Burnt. She had indeed been 
	a very bad Woman, but it seems, this Crime she was free froml, 
	for within a fortnight, or 3 Weeks after, her Daughter which
	had Accused her, came to the Judhes in open Court, (weep-
	ing and bowling) and confessed that she had wronged her Mo-
	ther, and unjustly out of s spleen she had against her, for not
	gratifying her in a thing she desired, had charged her with; 
	that Crime, which she was as innocent of as the Child unborn
	whereupon the Judges gave order for her Execution too.</p> 
	<p>There is no publick Calamity, but some ill People will serve
	themselves of the sad Providence, and make use of it for their 
	own ends, as Thieves, when a House or Town is on fire, will</p>
	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">steal</fw>
	<pb n="9"/>
	<header>The PREFACE</header>
	<p>steal and filch what thet can; yet there is no Fable, but hath
	some Foundation in History, so when wicked People make use
	of such Arguments against the Persons they hate, it's a sign
	there was such a thing, that gave them occasion to fic the Ca-
	lumny; and had not such things been done before, 
	they could not have any colour for their Villany.</p> 
	<p>I could add a known Passage, that hapned in the Year 
	1659, at Croffen in Silefia, of an Apothecaries Servant. 
	The chief Magistrate of that Town, at that time, was the 
	Princess ELizabeth Charlotta, a Person famous in her Ge-
	neration. In the Spring of the Year, one Christopher Mo-
	nigk, a Native of Serbeft, a Town belonging to the Princess
	of Anhalt, Servant to an Apothecary, Died and was Bu-
	ried with the usual Ceremonies of the Lutheran Church.  A
	few Days after his Decease, a shape exactly like him in Face, 
	Cloaths, Stature, Meen, &c. appeared in the Apothecary's
	Shop, where he would set himself down, and walk sometimes, 
	and take the Boxes, Pots, Glasses, off of the Shelves, and set 
	them again in their places, and sometimes try and examine the
	goodness of the Medicines, weigh them in a pair of Scales, 
	pound the Drugs with a mighty noise in the Mortar, nay, 
	serve the People that came with their Bills to the Shop, take
	their Money and lay it up safe in the Counter; in a word, do 
	all things that a Journey-man in such cafes uses to do- He 
	looked very ghastly upon those that had been his fellow Ser-
	vants, who were afraid to say any thing to him; and his
	Master being sick at that time of the Gout, he was often 
	very troublesome to him, would take the Bills that were brought
	him, out of his Hand, snatch away the Candle sometimes, and
	put it behind the Stove: At last, he took a Cloak that hung 
	in the Shop, put it on, and walked aborad, but minding no
	body in the Streets, went along, entered into Company, especially of
	such as he had formerly known, yet saluted no body, nor spoke 
	to any one but a Maid servant, whom he met hard by the 
	Church-yard, and desired to go home to his Master's House, 
	and dig in a ground Chamber, where she woyld find an in-
	estimable Treasure; but the Maid amazed at the sight of him,</p> 
	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">swooned;</fw> 
	<pb n="10"/>
	<header>The PREFACE</header>
	<p>swooned; whereupon he lifted her up, but left such a Mark up-
	on her Flesh with lifting her, that it was to be seen for sometime
	after. The Maid having recovered her self, went home, but 
	fell desperately sick upon it, and in her Sickness discovered 
	what Monigk had said to her; and accordingly they digged
	in the place she had named, but found nothing but an old decay- 
	ed Pot, with a Hæmaties or Blood-ftone in it. The Prin-
	cess hereupon, caused the young Man’s body to be digged up, 
	which they found putrefied with purulent Matter flowing from
	it; and the Master being adviced to remove the young Man’s 
	Goods, Linnens, Cloaths, and things he left behind him when 
	he died, out of the House, and was heard of no more. And 
	this some People now living will take their Oath upon, who 
	very well remember they saw him after his Decease, and the 
	thing being so notorious, there was instituued a publick Dis-
	putation about it, in the academy of
	*Leipfig, by one Henry Conrad, who
	<note>By reason of my ab-
	sence from the Press, 
	there was a Mistake in 
	the former Edition, 
	Where it is Witemberg</note> 
	Disbuted for his Doctors Degree in the
	University, And this puts me in mind
	of an Apothecary at Richenbach in Si-
	lefia, about 15 Years ago (I had it from a very creadible wit-
	nesses) who after his Death, appeared to divers of his Ac-
	quaintance; and cryed out, That in his life time he had Poy-
	soned several Men with his Drugs. Whereupon, the Magi-
	strates of the Town, after consultation, took up his Body, and 
	seen no more. But if the Stories related in the preceding Book
	are not sufficient to convince Men, I am sure an Example from
	beyond Sea will gain no credit. It's enough that he is not
	imposed upon by the following Narrative; and that it is not
	in the nature of those Pamplets they cry about the Streets con-
	taining very dreadful News from the Country, of Armies
	fighting in the Air.

	think of some way, whereby they might be delivered from
	that Calamity. They gave the Commissioners very strange In-

	<p>of Witches, he had drawn some Hundreds of Children to him, 
	and made them subject to his power; how he hath been seen
	to go in a visible shape through the Country, and appeared dai-
	ly to the people; how he had wrought upon the poorer sort, 
	by presenting them with Meat and Drink, and this way allu-
	red them to himself, with other circumstances to be mentioned 
	hereafter. The Inhabitants of the Village added, with very 
	great lamentations, that though their Children had told all, and
	themselves, fought God very earnestly by Prayer, yet they were 
	carried away by him; and therefore begg'd of the Lords Com-
	missioners to root out this hellish Crew, that they might regain
	the former rest and quiteness; and the rather, because the Children 
	which used to be carried away in the Country or District of 
	Elfdale, since some Withces had been burnt there, remained un-
	molested.</p> 
		<p>That day, i.e. the 13th of August, being the last Humilitati-
	on.day Instituted by Authority for removing of this Judgment, 
	the commissioners went to Church, where there appeared a 
	considerable assembly both young and old: the Children 
	could read most of them, and sing Psalms, and so could the
	Women, though not with any great zeal or fervour. There were
	preached two Sermons that day, in which the miserable cafe of 
	those people, that suffered themselves to be deluded bu the De-
	vil, was laid open; and these Semrons were at last concluded
	with very fevent prayer.</p>
		<p>The Publick Worship being over, all the people of the Town 
	were called togheter to the Parson's House near Three thousand
	of them. Silence being commanded, the King's Commission
	was read publickly in the hearing of them all, and they were
	charged under very great Penalties to conceal nothing of what 
	they knewand to say nothing but the truth; those especiallt, 
	who were guilty, that the Children might be delivered from the
	Clutches of the Devil. They all promised obedience; the guil-
	ty feignedly, byt the guiltless weeping and crying bitterly.</p>
		<p>On the 14th of August the Commisioners met again, consult-
	ing how they might withstand this dangerous flood; after long
	deliberation, an Oder also coming from his Majesty, they did
	resolve the execute such as the matter of fact could be proved
	upon; Examination being made, there were discovered no less
	than Threescore and ten in the Village aforesaid, Three and
	twenty of which freely confessed their Crimes, were condem-
	ned to dye; the rest, one pretending she was with Child, and
	the other denying and pleading not guilty, were sent to Faluna,
	where most of them were afterwards Executed.</p>

	<p>Fifteen Children which likewise confessed that they were en-
	gaged in this Witchery died as the rest; Six and thirty of them 
	between nine and sixteen years of age, who had been less guil-
	ty, were forced to run the gantlet; Twenty more, who had no 
	great inclination, yet had been reduced to those gellish Enter-
	prizes, because they were very young, were condemned to be 
	lash'd with Rods upon their hands, for three Sundays togheter 
	at the Church-door; and the aforelaid Sic and thirty were also
	doom'd to be lashed this way, once a weeb, for a whole year, to-
	gheter. The number of the Seduced Children was about three
	hundred.</p> 
		<p>On the twenty fifth of August, Execution was done upon the 
	notoriously guilt, the day being bright and glorious, and the 
	Sun shining, and some thousands of people being present at the
	Spectacle. The order and Method observed in the Examina-
	tion was thus.</p> 
		<p>First, the commisioners and the Neighbouring Justices went
	to prayer; this done, the Witches, who had most of them Chil-
	dren with them, which they either had Seduced, or attempted,
	to Saduce, from four years of age to sixteen, were set before 
	them. Some of the Children complained lamentably of the
	misery and mischief they were forced sometime to suffer of the
	Witches.</p>
		<p>The children being asked wheter they were sure, that they
	were at any time carried away by the Devil; they all declared 
	they were, begging of the Commissioners that they might be
	freed from that intolerable flavery.</p>
		<p>Hereupon the Witches themselves were asked, wheter the
	Confessions of these Children were true, and were admonished to
	confess the truth, that they might turn away from the Devil unto
	the living God. At first, most of them did very stiftly, and with-
	out shedding the least tear deny it, though much against thei
	will and inclination</p>
		<p>After this, the Children were Examined, every one by them-
	selves, to see wheter their confessions did agree or no; and the
	commissioners found that all of them, except some very little
	ones, who could not tell all the circumstances, did punctually
	agree in the confessions of particulars.</p> 
		<p>In the mean while the Commissioners that were of the Clergy 
	examined the Witches, could not bring them to any confession, 
	all continuing the steadfast in the denials, till at last some of them
	burst out into tears, and their confession agrreed with what the
	Children had said. And these expressed their abhorrency of the 
	fact, and begg'd pardon; adding, that the Devil, whom they</p>

	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">call'd</fw>
	<pb n="14"/>

	<head>The Collection</head>
	<p>call'd Loeyta(?), had stopt(?) the Mouths of some of them, and
	stopt the Ears of others; and being now gone from them, they
	could no longer conceal it, for they now perceived his Trea-
	chery.</p>
	<p>The Confession which the Witches made in Elfdale, to the
	Judges there, agreed with the Confession they made at Mohra
	and the chief things they confessed, conflicted in these three
	points,</p>
	<list>	
	1. Whither they used to go.
	2. What kind of place it was, they went to, called by them
	Blockula, where the Witches and the Devil used to meet.
	3. What evil mischief they had either done, or designed
	there.
	</list>
	<p>1: Of their Journey to Blockula. The Contents of their Confession.</p>
	<p>We of the Provence of Elfdale, do confess that we used to
	go to a Gravel-pit which lay hard by a cross-way, and there we
	put on a Vest over our heads, and then danced around, and after
	this ran to the cross-way, and called the Devil thrice, first with
	a still voice, the second time somewhat londer, and the third
	time very loud, with these words, Antecessor eome and carry us
	to Blockula. Whereupon, immediately he used to appear, but
	in different Habits; but of the most part we saw him in a gray
	Coat, and red and blew Stocking: he had a red Beard, a high-
	crown'd Hat, with Linnen of divers colours wrapt about it, and
	long Garters upon his Stockings.</p>
	<p>The he asked us, whether we would serve him with Soul
	and Body. If we were content to do so, he set us on a Beast
	which he had there ready, and carried us over Churches and
	high	 Walls; and  after all, we came to a green Meadow,
	where Blockula lies. We must procure some scrapings of Altars,
	and filings of Chrurch Clocks; and then he gives us a horn with
	a Salve on it, wherewhith we do anoint our selves; and a Saddle;
	whereupon we call upon the Devil, and away we go.</p>
	<p>Those that were of the Town of Mohra, made in a manner
	the same Declaration: Being asked whether they were sure of
	a real personal Transportation, and whether they were awake
	When it was done; they all answered in the Affirmative, and
	that the Devil sometimes laid something down in the place that
	was very like them, But one of them confessed that he did only
	take away her strength, and her body lay still upon the ground;
	yet sometimes he took even her body with him.</p>
	<pb n="15"/>																		Being

	<head>of Relations.</head>							
	<p>Being asked, how they could go with their Bodies through
	Chimneys and broken Panes of Glass, they said, that the Devil
	did first remove all that might hinder them in their flight, and
	so they had room enough to go.</p>
	<p>Others were asked, how they were able to carry so many
	Children with them ; and they answered, that when the Chil-
	dren were asleep they came into the Chamber, laid hold of the
	Children, which straightway did awake, and asked them whe-
	ther they would go to a Feast with them? To which some an-
	swered, Yes, others, No, yet they were all forced to go. They
	only gave the Children a Shirt, a Coat and a Doublet, which
	was either Red or Blew, and so they did set them upon a Beast
	of the Devils providing, and then they rid away.</p>
	<p>The Children confessed the same thing ; and some added,
	that because they had very clothes put upon them, they were
	very willing to go.</p>
	<p>Some of the Children concealed it from their Parents, but o-
	thers discover'd it to them presently.</p>
	<p>The Witchas declared moreover, that till of late they never
	had the power to carry away Children, but only this year and
	the last, and the Devil did at this time force them to it; that
	heretosore it was sufficient to carry but one of their Children or
	a strangers Child with them, which yet happened seldom, but
	now he did plague them and whip them if they did not procure
	him Children, insomuch that they had no peace nor quiet for
	him; and whereas formerly one journey a week would serve
	turn, from their own Town to the place aforesaid, now they
	were forced to run to other Towns and Places for Children, and
	that they brought with them, some fifteen, some sixteen Chil-
	dren every night.</p>
	<p>For their Journey, they said they made use of all sorts of In-
	struments, of Beasts, of Men, of Spits and Posts, according as
	they had opportunity: if they do ride upon Goats, and have
	many Children with them, that all may have room, they stick
	a spit into the back-side of the Goat, and then are anointed
	with the aforesaid Ointment. What the manner of their Jour-
	ney is, God alone knows: Thus much was made out, That if
	the Children did at any time name the Names of those that had
	carried them away, they were again carried by force either to
	Blockula, or to the Cross-way, and there miserably beaten, inso-
	much that some of them died of it: and this some of the Witch-
	es confessed; and added, That now they were exceeding trou-
	bled and tourtured in their minds for it.</p>

	<head>The Collection</head>
	<p>The Children thus used, lookt mighty bleak, wan and beaten.
	The marks of the Lashes, the Judges could not perceive in them,
	except in one Boy, who had some Wounds and holes in his Back,
	that were given him with Thorns; but the Witches said, they
	would quickly vanish.</p>
	<p>After this usage the Children are exceeding weak; and if any
	be carried over Night, they cannot recover themselves the next
	day;and they often fall into fits,the coming of which they know
	by an extraordinary paleness that seizes on the Children; and if
	a Fit comes upon them, they lean on their Mother's Arms,
	who sit up with them sometimes all Night; and when they
	observe the Paleness coming, shake the Children, but to no
	purpose.</p>
	<p>They observe farther, That their Childrens Breasts grow cold
	at such times; and they take sometimes a burning Candle and
	stick it in their Hair, which yet is not burnt by it. They
	Swoon upon this paleness, which Swoon lasteth sometime half
	an Hour, sometimes an Hour, sometimes two Hours, and when
	the Children come to themselves again, they mourn and lament,
	and groan most miserably, and beg exceedingly to be eased.
	This two old Men declared upon Oath before the Judges,and
	called all the Inhabitants of the Town to witness, as Persons
	that had most of them experience of this strange Symptome
	of their Children.</p>
	<p>A little Girl of Elfdale confessed, That naming the name of
	JESUS as she was carried away, she fell suddenly upon the
	Ground, and got a great hole in her Side, which the Devil
	presently healed up again, and away he carried her; and to
	this Day the Girl confessed, she had exceeding great pain in
	her Side.</p>
	<p>Another Boy confessed too, That one Day he was carried
	away by his Mistress, and to perform the Journey he took
	his own Father's Horse out of the Meadow where it was,
	and upon his return, she let the Horse go in her own Ground.</p>
	<p>The next Morning the Boys Father sought for his Horse,
	and not finding it, gave it over for lost; but the Boy told him
	the whole Story, and so his Father fetcht the Horse back again;
	and this one of the Witches confessed.</p>
	<p>2. Of the place where they used to assemble, called Blockula,
		and what they did there.</p>
	<p>They unanimously confessed, that Blockula is situated in a
	delicate large Meadow, whereof you can see no end.  The</p>
	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">place</fw>
	<pb n="17"/>								place
	<p n="7"/> 
	<head>of Relations.</head>						 
	<p>place or House they met at, had before it a Gate painted
	with diverse colours; through this Gate they went into a little
	Meadow distinct from the other, where the Beasts went, that
	they used to ride on:  but the Men whom they made use of
	in their Journey, stood in the House by the Gate in a slum-
	bering Posture, sleeping against the Wall.</p>
	<p>In a huge large Room of this House, they said, there stood
	a very long Table, at which the Witches did sit down: And
	that hard by this Room was another Chamber, where there
	were very lovely and delicate Beds.</p>
	The first thing, they said,they must do at Blockula was,
	That they must deny all, and devote themselves Body and
	Soul to the Devil, and promise to serve him faithfully, and con-
	firm all this with an Oath. Hereupon they cut their Fingers,
	and with their Blood writ their Name in this Book. 	They
	added, that he caused them to be Baptized too, by such Priests
	as he had there, and made them confirm their Baptism with
	dreadful Oaths and Imprecations.
	<p>Hereupon the Devil gave them a Purse, wherein there were
	filings of Clocks with a Stone tied to it, which they threw
	into the Water, and then were forced to speak these Words;
	as these filings of the Clock do never return to the Clock from
	which they are taken, so may my Soul never return to Heaven.
	To which they added Blasphemy and other Oaths and
	Curses.</p>
	<p>The mark of their cut Fingers is not found in all of them:
	But a Girl who had been slashed over her Finger, declared,
	that because she would not stretch out her Finger, the De-
	vil in Anger had so cruelly wounded it.</p>
	<p>After this they sat down to Table; and those that the
	Devil esteemed most, were placed nearest to him; but the
	Children must stand at the Door, where he himself gives
	them Meat and Drink.</p>
	<p>The Diet they did use to have there, was, they said, Broth
	with Colworts and Bacon in it, Oatmeal, Bread spread with
	Butter, Milk, and Cheese. And they added, that sometimes
	it tasted very well, and sometimes very ill. After Meals they
	went to Dancing, and in the mean while Swore and Cursed
	most dreadfully, and afterward went to fighting one with a-
	nother.</p>
	<p>Those of Elfdale confessed, That the Devil used to play
	upon an Harp before them, and afterwards to go with them
	that he liked best, into a Chamber, where he commited Ve-
	nerous Acts with them; and this indeed all confessed, That</p>
	<fw>I i 4</fw>	
	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">he</fw>
	<pb n="18"/>
	<p n="8"/> 
	<head>The Collection</head>
	<p>he had carnal knowledge of them, and that the Devil had Sons,
	and Daughters by them, which he did Marry togheter, and 
	they did couple togheter, and brought forth Toads and Ser-
	pants.</p>
	<p>One Day the Devil seemed to be dead, whereupon there 
	were great lemantetations at Blockula; but he soon awaked a-
	gain. If he hath a mind to be merry with them, he lets 
	them all ride upon Spits before him; takes afterwards the
	Spits and beats them black and blew, and then laughs at 
	them. And he bids them believe, that the day of Judg-
	ment will come speedily, and therefore lets them on work
	to build a great Hous of Stone, promising, that in that
	House he will preserve them from God's fury, and cause 
	them to enjoy the greatest delights and pleasures: But while
	they work exceeding hard at it, there falls a great part of
	the Wall down again, whereby some of the Witches are com-
	comonly hurt, which makes him laugh, but presently he cures
	them again.</p>
	<p>They sais, thay had seen sometimes a very great Devil
	like a Dragon, with Fire round about him, and bound with 
	an Iron Chain; and the Devil that converses with them tells
	them, that if they confess any thing, he will let that great
	Devil loose upon them, whereby all Swedeland shall come in-
	to great danger.</p>
	<p>They added, That the Devil had a Church there, such a-
	nother as in the Town of Mohra. When the commission-
	ers were coming. He told the Witches, they should not fear 
	them; for he would certainly kill them all. And they con-
	fessed, that some of them had attempted to Murther the Com-
	missioners, but had not ben able to effect it.</p>
	<p>Some of the Children talked much of a white Angel which
	used to forbid them what the Devil had bid them do, and
	told them that those doings should not last long: What had
	been done, had been permitted because of the wickedness of
	the People, and the carrying away of the Children should be 
	made manifest. And they added, that this white Angel would
	place himself sometimes at the Door betwixt the Witches and
	the Children; and when they come to Blockula, he pulled the 
	Children back, but the Witches they went in.</p>

	<p>3. Of the Mischief of Evil which the Witches promised to do to 
	Men and Beasts.</p> 
	<p>They confessed, That they were to promise the Devil, that 
	they would do all that's Ill; and that the Devil taught them to 
	Milk, which was in this wise: They used to stick a Knife in
	the Wall, and hang a kind of a Label on it, the Persons that they
	had power over, were miserably plagued, and the Beasts were 
	milked that way, till sometimes they died of it.</p>
	<p>A woman confessed, That the Devil gave her a wooden Knife, to 
	wherewith, going into Houses, she had power to kill anything
	she touched with it; yet there were very few that would confess
	that they had hurt any Man or Woman.</p>
	<p>Being asked wheter they had murdered any Children; they
	confessed, That they had indeed tormented many, but did not
	know whether any of them died of those Plagues. And added,
	That the Devil shewed them several places where he had po-
	wer to do mischief.</p>
	<p>The Minister of Elfdale declared, That one Night, these
	Witches were to his thinking, upon the crown of his Head, and
	that from thence he had long continued pain of the Head.</p>
	<p>One of the Witches confessed too, That the Devil had sent 
	her to torment that Minister; and that she was ordered to use a
	Nail, and strike it into his Head, but it would not enter very
	deep, and hence came that Head-ach.</p>
	<p>The aforesaid Minister said also, That one Night he felt a
	pain, as if he were torn with an Instrument that they clease
	Flax with, or a Flax-comb; and when he waked, he heared
	somebody scratching and scraping at the Window, but could see
	no body. And one of the Witches confessed, that she was the
	Person that dit it, being sent by the Devil.</p> 
	<p>The minister of Mohra declared also, that one Night, one of 
	these Witches came into his House, and did so violently take
	him by the Throat, that he thought he should have been choak-
	ed; and waking, he saw the Person that did it, but could not
	know her; and for some Weeks he was not able to Speak, 
	or perform Divine Service.</p>
	<p>An old Woman of Elfdale confessed, That the Devil had
	helpt her to make a Nail, which she struck into a Boy's Knee, 
	of shich stroak the Boy remained lame a long time. And
	she added, That before she was burnt, or Excecuted by the Hand
	of Justice, the Boy would recover.</p> 
	<fw type="catch" place="bot-right">They</fw>
	<pb n="20"/>
	<p n="10"/> 
	<head>The collection</head>
	<p>They confessed also, That the Devil gives them a Beast a-
	bout the bigness and shape of a young Cat, which they call a 
	Carrier; and that he gives them a Bird too, as big as a Raven, 
	but White; and these two Creatures they can fend any where,
	and wherever they come, they take away all forts of Victuals
	they can get, Butter, Cheese, Milk, Bacon, and all sorts of 
	Seeds, whatever they find, and carry it to the Witch. What
	the Bird brings they may keep for themselves, but what the
	Carrier brings, they must reserve for the Devil, and that's 
	brought to Blockula, where he doth give them of it so much as
	he thinks fit.</p>
	<p>They added likewise, that these Carriers fill themselves so full
	sometimes, that they are forced to spue by the way, which
	spuing is found in several Gardens, where Colworts grow, and 
	not far from the Houses of those Witches. It is of a yellow
	Colour like Gold, and is called Butter of Witches.</p> 
	<p>The Lords Commissioners were indeed very earnest, and 
	took great pains to persuade them to shew some of their Tricks, 
	but to no purpose; for they did all unanimously confess, that
	since they had confessed all, they found that all their Witch-
	craft was gone, and that the Devil at this time appeared to them
	very terrible, with Claws on his Hands and Feet, and with
	Horns on his Head, and a long tail behind, shewed to them
	a Pit burning, with a Hand put out; but the Devil did thrust
	the Person down again with an Iron-fork; and suggested to the
	Witches, that if they continned in their Confession, he would
	deal with them in the same manner.</p> 
	<p>The above-said Relation is taken out of the publick Register, 
	where all this is related with more circumstances. And at this 
	time, through all the Country, there are prayers Weekly in all
	Churches, to the end, that almighty God would pull down the
	Devil's power, and deliver these poor Creatures, which have
	hitherto groaned under it.</p>
