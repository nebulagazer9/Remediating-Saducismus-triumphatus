# Remediating Saducismus Triumphatus🧙🏼‍♀️
This repository is an assembly point for the main material associated with a group project in the Multimodality course at the University of Borås, Sweden.
## The assignment
The group members collaborate to remediate a chosen artefact. The artefact is a digitalised "Saducismus Triumphatus" (third edition) by Joseph Glanvill.
### Special note
Because of time limitations and the book's length, only a part of a specific chapter will be remediated. Said chapter tells parts of the Mora witch trial in Sweden in the years 1669 and 1670 and upwards. 
#### PS
Unless curiosity is too strong, pay no mind to the chapter's last part...
